## Procurement Strategy

For several decades the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) contract has included scope for both coordination work for the organ donation and transplantation ecosystem as well as the technology that supports that coordination. When it comes to organ donation reform, it is important to have a buying approach that best supports that reform. This includes the government partnering with vendors who have core competencies in coordination, which are different from the vendors who have a core competence in digital services.

Through our team’s research, it has become abundantly clear that the current OPTN contractor has been unsuccessful at both scopes. Since the research team’s competencies are service design and digital services, we focused on a new procurement which would only include scope for digital services related to organ donation. The aim of this document is to eventually lead to a contract that enables, facilitates, and incentivizes digital services delivery with a vendor awardee that embodies and predominantly undertakes practices from the Digital Services Playbook. As one part of the research process, we interviewed five non-traditional vendors to understand potential barriers to entry for winning this procurement and gain insight around what would level the playing field for new, non-traditional vendors to bid for the OPTN technology work.

The documented approach is represented in the [TechFAR Hub](https://techfarhub.cio.gov/), as well as part of the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO)  [Agile Assessment Guide](https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/709711.pdf) and focused on outcomes above prescribed technical features. This approach is specifically applied to the organ donation and transplantation ecosystem through our research, and the result is represented here.


### Erosion of Government’s Leverage

The government currently finds itself in a situation of little leverage compared to the OPTN contractor’s high leverage. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to achieve a fair business deal using a contract. As indicated immediately below, there are numerous forces that have contributed to the government's low leverage, some dating back to over thirty years ago.



*   **National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) of 1984 limiting Govt’s ability to innovate**, _1984_
*   **Govt’s accepting vendor’s intellectual property (IP) rights which creates vendor lock-in**, _1986/first UNOS contract, though IP rights ownership happened later_
*   **Renewing contracts to poor performers**, _numerous times, most recently 2018_
*   **Atrophy of Govt’s technical acumen**, _2001-2020_
*   **Contracting’s ineffectiveness in creating competitive pressures**, _each renewal_
*   **Inexperience with buying digital services**, _2020-present_

Due to this imbalance, the Government finds itself at a significant disadvantage when striking an equitable deal with the existing OPTN vendor. As part of the proposed approach to buying, we focused on what would facilitate a significant rebalancing of that power.

The OPTN contract has been re-awarded, since it’s beginning, to the same vendor[^1]. This has included a multi-year sole-source award at the end of one contract, and during a separate procurement recompete there was just one bid received (from the existing contractor). From a procurement operations perspective, the process executed appears to follow all of the procurement regulations. From the perspective of procurement best practices and optimizing around competition, our research found very little substance. As a result, we have developed an approach that will significantly increase competitive pressures and solve other systemic problems identified in the existing contracting for organ donation work.


### Problems to Solve In Buying OPTN Technology

Our research uncovered a number of problems with the current and previous OPTN procurements, which are listed immediately below. The team developed an approach that aims to solve these problems. The list below is not intended to be comprehensive of all issues addressed within this strategyy but it highlights some of the prominent challenges we have identified.



*   **Wrong Objectives**: The objectives from the existing contract do not support doing the most good for the most amount of people (in the organ transplant space)
*   **Short Proposal Window**: The 31 days to submit a complete proposal has been inadequate for vendors to compete well (except for the incumbent)
*   **Technology Poverty**: The technology is characterized by slow delivery of new features and lackluster security
*   **Unempowered End Users**: End users have small voices when it comes to communicating problems to those who can best solve those problems
*   **Government’s poor leverage**: Existing technology is proprietary and therefore difficult for non-incumbents to improve upon
*   **Non-Profits Only Awarded**: 42 US 274 prescribes awarding to a non-profit
*   **Past Performance / Corporate Experience**: 42 USC 274 indicates that the vendor shall have _expertise in organ procurement and transplantation_


### A Strategic Procurement Pivot

Since the advent of the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), modern technology development approaches have significantly advanced. This involves incremental approaches to developing software in rapid agile cycles while gaining frequent feedback from end users. Only a non-traditional procurement approach can effectively support and leverage the benefits of modern technology practices. Done poorly, a contracting approach can easily block the delivery of digital services. Done well, a digital service contracting approach facilitates both (1) awarding to a modern technology vendor and (2) providing appropriate flexibility and incentives in the contract that enable — not strangle — innovative approaches to solving problems using digital services.


### Traditional IT Procurement vs. Digital Services Procurement

Traditional information technology (IT) procurement involves establishing plans to have vendors build technology in an antiquated way - in fact, the way that was common 30+ years ago. While the research team did not have access to the base code of the existing systems involved in organ procurement, architectural diagrams and interviews point to an outdated set of systems developed decades ago. During one research interview, a leading healthcare technology executive described the incumbent’s technology inner workings, such as ranking algorithms, as “literally duct tape.” Numerous interviewees indicated a poor user experience with organ placement technology, and several complained that it takes the contractor 12+ months to deliver new, yet relatively small, features once those features are mandated by federal regulation. We found little evidence that the existing OPTN contractor either engages closely with, or develops technology closely with, end users.

We’ve made several specific suggestions to help move the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)  from a traditional government IT buying approach to a digital services buying approach for OPTN tech. This includes allowing for more innovation by using a Statements of Objectives, and using a clear problem statement and product vision to guide the overall efforts for the OPTN technology work. 


## Implementing an Acquisition Strategy Focused on Objectives


### Statement of Objectives

A Statement of Objectives (SOO) provides basic, high level objectives of the acquisition and is the least prescriptive choice of a requirements document. It allows industry to re-imagine innovative approaches to achieving the objectives related to organ donation reform. The SOO opens up the acquisition to a wider range of potential solutions. While the SOO is included in the Request for Proposals (RFP), it will not be a part of the eventual contract. In response to the SOO, vendors submit a technical approach in the form of a Statement of Work (SOW) which clearly describes the performance objectives and standards that are expected of the vendor.


### Problem Statement 

More unusual, although helpful, is including a problem statement in the RFP. A clear and concise problem statement provides a laser focus for the problem solvers - the digital service vendors. In a government procurement, both the government and the contractor should be driving towards solving the same problem. The problem statement, just like the Statement of Objectives, should use plain language so that as many people as possible can grasp the concept without further explanation. This also helps define the project scope, which keeps the project concentrated on the overall goal.


### Product Vision

Up to this point, the OPTN contract scope has been too prescriptive about the technology to be built and maintained. This traditional approach to government procurement typically limits innovation only to those solution ideas created by a few people in government involved in the procurement. A Request for Information (RFI) asking for a written response can, if constructed well, provide some additional ideas from industry to government. However, the exchange as a result of an RFI typically results in very small changes to the overall level of innovative ideas since the final Performance Work Statement or Statement of Work remains prescriptive in terms of technology approach.

  

The product vision is the overarching goal of the technology product/solution. It provides the target customer, a statement of need, the product name, the product category, the key benefit, the primary competitive alternative, and makes clear what makes the digital product primarily different. This product vision should be _the_ technology scope for the OPTN technology contract. It should be clear and accurate. It also provides the ultimate goal for all the work to be performed. When combined with vendor submissions that propose a modern technology process (as opposed to locking in technical features at the contract level), the government (partnered with the awarded vendor) have tremendous flexibility to iteratively build a technology product that can evolve at the pace of end users needs.


### Buy a repeatable process, not predefined technical features

For some procurements, the problems to solve are simple, there is a deep understanding of end users, and details about the existing technology are transparent. In those cases structuring a procurement around predefined features may be most appropriate. An example is buying a ubiquitous technology such as an email solution. The government can expect several existing and competitive products available in the market.

This is not the case with organ donation. The problems to be solved are complex. There is still much to be learned about the end users and their problems. Their problems have and will change over time. Visibility into the existing technology is opaque at best. In those situations, it is critical to contract for a vendor that excels at modern technology best practices such as the Digital Services Playbook. Those vendors follow an iterative, yet mature, repeatable process for building modern technology, such as agile software development. The vendor’s repeatable process, which delivers working software every few weeks, should be explained in great detail in the vendor technical proposal and is at the core of the contract scope (not the technical scope, which is the Product Vision).

By buying a repeatable process that delivers working software, the government is not contractually locked into buying technical features defined pre-contract which it assumes solves end users’ problems. Buying a repeatable process provides a way to get working software into the users of OPTN tech, get their feedback every few weeks, and then rapidly pivot and change or enhance those features within a few weeks to validate whether or not the technology solves their problem. This process provides a structured approach to release software into production frequently, which is a cornerstone of agile software development. In contrast, the existing OPTN vendor typically takes upwards of 12 months to deliver new features into their production environment.


### Down-Select

Previous OPTN procurements required vendors to submit all parts of the proposal together at once. This traditional procurement approach requires high business development costs, while vendors receive little, if any, indication of their chances of award until the government has made an official contract award decision. Small businesses, with their limited business development budgets, find the approach especially burdensome.

The down-select process is a very powerful tool in the agency's acquisition toolbelt that saves time for both the government and vendors. The down-select is a phase in the procurement lifecycle that requires the evaluation of some information (for example, past experience, technical skill sets) to determine the likelihood of a vendor's success in winning the contract. The down-select can be either mandatory or voluntary. The initial phase of a down-select should involve low business development cost yet be effective at eliminating vendor’s who’s probability of winning the contract award is low. Through later phases of the down-select, the increased business development cost is commensurate with a higher likelihood of award. Our research indicated that small businesses favored the down-select approach for the OPTN technology procurement.

When the government gives transparent feedback to vendors throughout the process — including when some proposals have a low probability of winning — this allows vendors to decide whether they want to put more time and resources into the procurement process. For this procurement, we recommend the following down-select process:



1. Case Studies
2. Design Challenge
3. Written Technical Approach, Price Submission, and Offer & Award Documents, Certifications and Representations


### Case Studies

Case studies can provide vendors a light weight initial submission in a multi-phase down-select. As opposed to a traditional past performance submission, the vendors for OPTN tech should be directed to submit case studies from work performed by their company to deliver digital services. Vendors with inexperience in digital services will struggle to provide a sufficient story, which leaves an opportunity for the government to communicate to such a vendor that they are unlikely to receive an eventual award and therefore strongly discourage their continued pursuit of the OPTN tech award. 


### Design Challenge

The previous OPTN procurements only allowed for written proposal submissions. This traditional government procurement approach does not force vendors to show how they can perform the work. It allows vendors to make assertions in a proposal while making it difficult for the government team to validate those assertions within the procurement process itself. As an example, in the 2018 RFP charges the vendor to “Develop innovative applications to enhance the matching function used by OPTN members” (Performance Work Statement section 3.4.2). However, the procurement strategy did not include an effective way for the vendor to simulate, or show in some way, how the company would deliver modern technology, let alone innovation. Our research only found evidence of poor, outdated technology practices from the contract awardee.

Conversely, a design challenge provides a "show, don't tell" in the procurement and is a tool that has proven effective in removing digital service vendor imposters during the procurement. The design challenge is arguably the single most important part of the procurement evaluation process. Because each procurement is different, the design challenge for OPTN technology needs to be customized to align with the key components of the Statements of Objectives.

To get the most accurate insight into each vendor's ability to successfully execute against the product's objectives, the government needs to craft a challenge that closely matches the type of work that will be involved in the product development. If the procurement is for a very technical product or service, the challenge should be technical. Alternatively, if the procurement will be product management heavy, the challenge could include building out a product roadmap with prioritized milestones.

The government will need to come up with a realistic scenario that vendors can respond to with either working software, design artifacts (for example, wireframes), product management approaches (for example, product milestones and backlog of prioritized work), or any other range of artifacts that will be essential for the specific procurement.


### Revisit Past Performance

42 USC 274 indicates that the vendor shall have expertise in organ procurement and transplantation. This dictates that an Offeror’s past performance in this expertise must be evaluated as part of the proposal. The 2018 RFP specified that vendors would be evaluated on, “The Vendor (organization) experience... in the field of organ transplantation based on a minimum of 3 years of corporate experience in managing projects of similar scope and complexity in the field of organ  transplantation.”

We had difficulty identifying leading technology vendors in the organ transplantation space that managed similar scope and complexity to the scope of the requirement/contract. This requirement has contributed to HRSA’s lack of meaningful competition. In addition, modern technology vendors have the ability to coordinate highly complex situations including organ donation transplantation. We recommend the following changes:



*   Eliminate the minimum amount of years of corporate experience in the specific organ transplantation field
*   Indicate that vendors with no experience in the field of organ transplantation receive a neutral score for past performance
*   Structure the past performance technical factor as _far less important_ than any other Technical Factor

The last recommendation regarding relative importance is especially critical. The government is communicating that past performance must be evaluated in some way, shape or form but overall the government sees past performance as having little importance when it comes to which vendor can receive the contract award. Therefore whether a vendor’s past performance in this specific area is strong or weak, it is of little consequence to the ultimate decision for who will receive the award. The suggested changes above, when combined, will effectively neutralize organ placement past performance from being a barrier to entry for competitors for the OPTN technology work. The past performance requirement seen in previous OPTN procurements will no longer dissuade vendors from providing effective competitive submissions.


### Vendor Pool 

The technology scope of the OPTN contract has been fulfilled by one vendor. Our research indicates the vendor maintains an antiquated technology and limited technical acumen. We suggest contracting with a vendor that embodies modern technology approaches such as the Digital Services Playbook. Most of the companies that excel at digital service delivery in government are still small businesses. 

The incumbent vendor asserts that they are the only company capable of providing the technology solution. However, our research—which included analysis of current technology, user research interviews, as well as interviews with digital service vendors--found that several other vendors can and are willing to deliver superior technology. Due to the size and scope of work to be performed, we believe that contracting with multiple vendors will be most advantageous since a single digital services vendor does not have core competencies in all relevant areas necessary to solve the technology problems identified.

For example, a technology company with core competencies in building technology infrastructure usually does not also have a core competency in human centered design. However, both are critical to building a successful digital product for organ donation. Therefore, a procurement approach that gives the government easy access to multiple vendors, with complementary core competencies, will position the government best for building the desired product.

We recommend the use of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). The government first conducts an initial competition to establish a small pool of pre-qualified vendors that excel at digital service delivery. Once awarded, the government conducts smaller, rapid competitions for individual task orders. Using a BPA, the government can expect similar benefits to those from CMS’s Quality Payment Program (QPP) BPA: low/zero award protests, average procurement action lead time is 67 days, 2-week RFP release to submission cycle time, and flexibility to change vendors more quickly.

While a BPA has many strengths, it is a tool that must be wielded by capable talent. Failure is likely in the hands of a government team inexperienced at managing digital teams and coordinating multiple vendors building a common digital product. However, when the government team is high functioning, has modern technology skills and system integration management skills, the BPA can offer the team tremendous flexibility and capacity to rapidly deliver modern technology compared to traditional government technology implementations.


### Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

A QASP consists of a roles and responsibilities section that describes the formal relationship between the vendor and the government's contracting specialist/officer. It will also describe the performance metrics the vendor will adhere to based on their proposal, which describe how the government can verify each metric.

While the roles and responsibilities included in a QASP tend to be fairly static across modular procurements, the performance metrics should both be generic as well as tailored to the product that's being delivered by the vendor. A good QASP will have objective-based performance metrics. These performance metrics can come in many forms, including progress towards a desired result, the dependability of something, or the security of a system.

The measurement of these performance metrics is important, and measuring them should be easy. Due to the poor metrics and lack of accountability in the current OPTN contract, a strong QASP will serve as an important motivator to perform well under the new contract. While the 2018 OPTN RFP included a QASP, it provided a very low standard for the technology provided. Our team instead provided a QASP in the draft RFP that demands the vendor’s excellence in modern technology practices.


### Pricing Structure

Our research found that HRSA’s contracting of IT services usually used a price structure that is cost type. Cost type contracts require rigid cost accounting standards from the vendors which are most appropriate for research and development contracts - especially for scope related to non-commercial items. That is appropriate for building tanks, but modern technology services were developed in the private industry and therefore commercial services. Therefore pricing structures more common in the commercial industry are more appropriate, including labor hours/time and materials or firm fixed price.


### Basis for Award

Similar to the majority of government IT procurements, the 2018 OPTN RFP included a tradeoff between Technical Factors and Price, which considers the mix between technical and price to arrive at an overall best value determination. The 2018 RFP indicated the technical proposal (excludes price/cost) when “combined they are significantly more important than the Cost Factor.” But this approach means that the Government may have to sacrifice the best technical proposal for a proposal with a lower price.

Digital service vendors deliver some of the best technologies in government, yet oftentimes provide pricing higher than average government IT vendor pricing per hour. There are a number of factors contributing to this, most importantly is the vendors’ compensation plan which is critical to attracting and retaining talent from Silicon Valley. The government should consider however, the total lifecycle costs for the technology delivered, as well as the value provided by a digital services vendor when compared to traditional government IT vendors.

One digital service vendor interviewed by our team indicated that development of scalable, flexible, architecture may be very high during years 1 and 2 of a project (especially because of senior level architects required by the vendor). But after that first year or two, the costs to maintain well built infrastructure as a service is very low compared to traditional government IT vendors. In addition, well built modern infrastructure is a key ingredient to future-proofing the overall technology solution.

Since the best digital service vendors may have higher hourly rates than traditional government IT vendors, it is incumbent upon the government to communicate how superior technical approaches significantly overshadow proposed labor hours price. An effective means of wiring this value at the tactical level of the procurement involves adjusting the Basis for Award to indicate the following:

*   There is no tradeoff between any of the Technical Factors and Price
*   The Offeror’s price must be fair and reasonable

Our suggested approach above decreases the risk of forcing the Government’s hand to award to a vendor with lower than the best technical score - which is usually a competitor who has less technical capability but has underbid the price in a way that endangers sustained product delivery. The suggested tactic allows the Government to let only the highest technically rated proposal make it ‘over the bar’ to be considered for pricing. The Government will then determine whether the vendor with the highest technically rated proposal also has pricing that is fair and reasonable. The government should be careful to consider whether the pricing is fair and reasonable according to the commercial industry including the high tech labor market, not simply comparing the proposed labor rate to government sector pricing such as the average hourly rate found on the [GSA Calc tool](https://calc.gsa.gov/). If the price is not found to be fair and reasonable, the Government will repeat that determination for the next highest technically rated proposal. This approach provides the Government a way to more easily contract with the vendor with the highest technical score -- the vendor that can do the work best.
